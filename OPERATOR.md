This document outlines the steps to set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Docker:** Docker is recommended to run Minikube with the Docker driver.  Follow the instructions for your operating system:

     *   **macOS:** [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac/)
     *   **Windows:** [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
     *   **Linux:** [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2.  **Install Kubectl:** Kubectl is required to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

     *   **macOS:** [Install kubectl on macOS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/)
     *   **Windows:** [Install kubectl on Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)
     *   **Linux:** [Install kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

## Install Minikube

1. Visit the [minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)
2. Follow the instructions for your platform. 
3. Verify that the minikube command is installed correctly `minikube --help`. 
   If the help is not displayed and your system cannot find the `minikube` command. Veriy that the binary is available in your PATH. 

## Start Minikube Cluster

It is recommended to use the Docker driver for your cluster, this is the default option. This means you're kubernetes cluster will run inside of a single docker container. 
We also recommend adding additonal resources as the default resources are often not enough. 

1. `minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 16G`
2. It may take some time for the cluster to get started and pull in the appropriate resources. 
3. Minikube should add a context into your kubeconfig, by default it is located at: `~/.kube/config`
4. You can verify the cluster is running by displaying all of the default pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kube-system   coredns-6f6b679f8f-896h7           1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   kube-proxy-45lkz                   1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   1 (21h ago)   15d
kube-system   storage-provisioner
```

5. As mentioned above, the entire cluster is running inside a minikube docker container, you can verify this with a simple docker command

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                                                                                                                                  NAMES
0a694fae3253   gcr.io/k8s-minikube/kicbase:v0.0.45   "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   2 weeks ago     Up 21 hours   127.0.0.1:58913->22/tcp, 127.0.0.1:58914->2376/tcp, 127.0.0.1:58916->5000/tcp, 127.0.0.1:58917->8443/tcp, 127.0.0.1:58915->32443/tcp   minikube
```


## Troubleshooting

Some possible reasons and solutions for Minikube failing to start: 

- Verify that the docker daemon is running. 
  - `docker ps` should not return an error. If it does it's possible the the docker daemon or docker desktop is not running. 
  - If you are using linux, it is recommended to add your user to the docker group so you do not need to run sudo for every docker command. Follow the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

- Requesting more resources available to the docker daemon.
  - When using docker desktop, it's possible that the requested for minikube are not availble to the docker daemon yet. 
  - Open docker desktop, click settings and verify in the resources tab that Docker has the available resources.

kubectl connection issues: 
Ensure that the kubectl context is correctly set to minikube.
- `kubectl config get-contexts` will show you all of your available kubernetes contexts. 
- If you have multiple context and minikube is not selected you need to set it: `kubectl config use-context minikube`



## Cleanup

To stop Minikube:
```bash
minikube stop
```

To delete the Minikube cluster:
```bash
minikube delete
```
