This document discusses strategies for scaling the solution across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## Managing Multiple Clusters

Terraform workspaces or separate Terraform state files can be used to manage multiple clusters.  Each cluster would have its own set of configuration files and state.

## Centralized RBAC Management

For centralized RBAC, consider using an external identity provider and integrating it with Kubernetes.  Tools like Keycloak or Dex can be used for this purpose.  Terraform can then be used to configure RoleBindings based on user groups from the identity provider.

## Automation

Tools like Argo CD or Flux can be used to automate the deployment of infrastructure changes across multiple clusters.

## Consistency and Manageability

Maintaining consistency across clusters can be challenging.  Using GitOps principles and infrastructure-as-code helps to ensure that all clusters are configured consistently.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Drift Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect configuration drift across clusters.
- **Rollout Strategies:** Define clear rollout strategies for infrastructure changes to minimize disruption.

## Tools and Technologies

- Terraform Workspaces/Modules
- Argo CD/Flux
- Keycloak/Dex
